    <p id = "description">Below are three product images with labels, the images display in a row when the pixel width of the media is over 1000px and switches to a column when below 1000px, allowing people to veiw easier on thinner media. The image size is also increased when in a column as the viewport width is no longer shared between 3 images. Note that the links on the header are only noticibly different when the images are in a column.</p>
